I'm going to share some incredible insights I've come across in the past two weeks. The world is moving at an accelerated speedâ€”something you might not fully notice from Bangladesh. So let me give you a snapshot of what's happening.  

 **1. AI Efficiency & Cost Reduction**  
The efficiency and cost reduction in AI are doubling every four months. At this rate, AI is on track to become commoditizedâ€”meaning it will be as accessible as using a gas stove, a mobile phone, or the internet.  

ðŸ”— **Watch:** [Bob McGrewâ€™s interview on Y Combinator's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/YCombinator) for more insights.  

 **2. AGI is Closer Than We Think**  
- **Demis Hassabis** (DeepMind CEO) predicts AGI in **3-5 years**.  
- **Dario Amodei** (Anthropic Co-founder) and **Sam Altman** (OpenAI Co-founder) share a **similar timeline**.  
- **Lex Fridman** predicts **by 2030**.  
- **My take**: Sooner than 2030, but my definition of AGI is different.  

 **3. The Small Model Breakthrough**  
If a small model like **Microsoft Phi** can achieve **GPT-4 level reasoning** using just **common sense data** and carefully selected reasoning datasets, it would **shatter the foundation model industry**.  

This means we may no longer need massive clusters for training. Some fascinating research is happening in this space.

 **4. Vertical AI Agents Are the Startup Play**  
The AI startup trend is shifting towards **Vertical AI Agents**â€”specialized AI tailored to specific industries. Examples include:  
- **Voice Agent for Designers**  
- **Research Agent for Lawyers**  

YC has a new **Request for Startups (RFS) list**â€”worth checking out.  

 **5. Google Referrals Are Down**  
Google referrals dropped **15% in the last year**, according to YC research. Not officially in Google's annual report yet, but an important trend to watch.  

**6. Stack Overflowâ€™s Traffic Collapse**  
Stack Overflowâ€™s traffic started declining in **2022**, even before ChatGPT. The primary reason? **GitHub Copilot.**  

ðŸš¨ Stack Overflow traffic is **down 60% this year**.  

 **7. Economic Shifts & AI's Impact**  
Historically, whenever humanity found new ways to generate wealth, it worked out well. Example:  
- **97% of the world's population were farmers** â†’ Now less than **3%**.  

AI is the next waveâ€”how will we adapt?  

**8. AI in Healthcare: A Game Changer**  
AI has **huge potential in healthcare**, helping meet demand where human resources fall short. This is an area of **tremendous opportunity** for innovation.  

 **9. The Value of Evaluation Sets**  
A YC founder working on an AI agent said:  
> *"The most valuable thing our company built is the eval set."*  

Why? The **evaluation set** (tests that verify correct AI behavior) is critical to ensuring quality AI products.

 **10. The Challenge of Internal Search**  
Nobody has cracked **internal search** yetâ€”meaning **searching within Google Drive, Docs, or personal files**.  

Why? Internal indexing is vastly different from **web indexing**.

 **11. The Role of Search in AI Understanding**  
To go beyond mere pattern matching, **AI models need search**. Without it, they can't truly "understand."  

This is why **"curiosity" = search.**

 **12. The DeepSeek Moment & AI Cold War**  
The **DeepSeek moment** has shaken the US AI industry and could lead to a **Cold War** over AI dominance.  

AI might be a **winner-takes-all** game due to the challenges of inference and compute. The country that solves this first will **dominate the global AI market**.

 **13. AI Job Displacement is Real**  
AI is rapidly automating **skill-specific jobs**, while **management roles** are becoming more valuable.  

The most critical skill?  
> **Knowing what products to build.**  

This is why **Product Managers (PMs)** are becoming more essential.

### **Final Thoughts**  
AI is accelerating at an **unprecedented rate**, reshaping industries, jobs, and even global power dynamics. The next decade will be transformative. If you're not paying attention, you might miss the wave.
